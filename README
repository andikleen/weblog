Simple web log analysis tools

Originally written long ago.

Written for apache, but should work with all web servers generating 
standard logs. This is a light weight alternative to more complex
database based setups. The output is simple ASCII that 
can be easily processed further in shell pipelines. They can be also
combined for more complex tasks.

One big advantage is simplicity, so can be easily adapted for specific
purposes.

It uses multiple passes through the logs and will likely not scale
to large logs. However it works quite well for moderate sized logs.

If you don't know how to use it just run weball <log>

Tools:

weball log
# run all analyses on a log
# somewhat slow for larger logs, because it does many passes

# extract search engine search terms from a http log
# referer logging needs to be enabled
# options:
# -n list numeric ips in front
